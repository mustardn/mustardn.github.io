title: About me
---

My name is Natalie Mustard. I am a data scientist, currently working as a consultant with Deloitte Canada.

### My Story

I took an alternate path to get where I am today. In 2016 I completed my undergrad at Queen's University, where I studied mechanical engineering. I was a member of the Baja SAE Design team, where I my roots in the auto industry started. Not long after graduation, I started my career as a Product Engineer at Ford Motor Company. I packed up my life in Toronto, and settled in Detroit Michigan.

After about 2 years, I decided mechanical engineering and the automotive industry were not for me. I had been reading a lot about the future of data science and AI, the idea of building things with code to make predictions sounded interesting to me, so I applied to the Master of Engineering program at the University of Toronto. Having had very little coding experience, I was nervous about starting my new journey. The courses I was taking expected a prior knowledge of Python, so I was expected to learn how to code while also completing all the homework and assignments.

### My Hobbies

I love video games. It's a fairly recent hobby of mine, it all started when the pandemic hit, looking for something to do while everything was shut down. I was fortunate enough to get my hands on a PS5 on release. Games I enjoy include:

- The Witcher 3
- God of War
- The Last of Us Part 2 (apparently a very divisive game)
- Bloodborne

During the pandemic, I joined a video gaming community on Discord, and have made some incredible friends online. We even had a meetup in Ottawa! It's been great to find those outlets online for connection and to left off steam when I feel any burnout.
