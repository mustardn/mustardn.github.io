title: About me
---

My name is Natalie Mustard. I am a data scientist, currently working as a consultant with Deloitte Canada.

I took an alternate path to get where I am today. In 2016 I completed my undergrad at Queen's University, where I studied mechanical engineering. I was a member of the Baja SAE Design team, where I my roots in the auto industry started. Not long after graduation, I started my career as a Product Engineer at Ford Motor Company. I packed up my life in Toronto, and settled in Detroitte Michigan.

After about 2 years, I decided mechanical engineering and the automotive industry were not for me. 

### My story

To be honest, I'm having some trouble remembering right now, so why don't you just watch [my movie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Princess_Bride_%28film%29) and it will answer **all** your questions.
